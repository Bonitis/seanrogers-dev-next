            Occasionally I am asked for advice, tips, or resources about
            starting a company or joining an early stage startup for the first
            time. You have probably never heard of me because I never worked at
            a FAANG/MAANG/MAAAN company or founded a unicorn. What I have done
            is work at 9 different startups, from pre-seed to series E. Two of
            those companies were as a Cofounder, with one being a complete
            failure and the other leading to a successful exit. I was lucky
            enough to participate in a{' '}

            met amazing people and gathered up bits of incredibly helpful
            information.

            This is a list of the boring stuff. The things you wouldn&apos;t think of
            on your own, but wish you had. It isn&apos;t about product-market fit how
            to do pricing, or building scalable tech. There are smarter people
            than me putting out content about those topics all over the place
            and I encourage you to seek them out. Instead, this is about
            surfacing the little details that will make it feel like you&apos;re a
            serial entrepreneur even though you have no idea what you&apos;re doing.

            Did you know that all the big tech companies have programs to give

            you can survive a little longer without giving away all your equity.

                Troy Henikoff from MATH Venture Partners put together an amazing series on building a financial model, and why it is important
                for founders to build one from scratch. While this is an incredibly useful tool for communicating with investors, it also forces
                you to think about all of your assumptions and gives your a framework for proving if they are correct.

                This book was written by Brad Feld, a cofounder of Techstars, and was required reading for the program. Ever since I read it I have
                recommended it to anyone starting a company or even joining a startup. Funding a company is an entire world of new vocabulary and concepts.
                Reading Venture Deals is the fastest way to understand the mechanics of venture funding for both founders and employees. If you are looking
                to join a startup, this will help you ask the right questions to evaluate the equity part of your compensation.

                Unless you are a solo founder, you likely have others working on this project with you. If you are not already close to those
                people, you will be. You will spend so much time with your chosen team that they will be like family. While you may want to
                avoid discussing negative possibilities, it is important to get ahead of disputes and disagreements that will come in the future.
                Building a Founders or Operating agreement can take all of the guesswork out of those situations. You create it while everyone
                is happy and looking out for each other. Deciding what rules are in place when something does go wrong gives you an objective
                answer and removes emotion from the process.
