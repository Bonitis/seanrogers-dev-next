[Ekos Order Hub](https://www.goekos.com/orderhub/) is a digital portal for your distributors and customer accounts to see available inventory and enter and manage orders. It is built using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as a progressive web app, and connects to a REST api built in .NET hosted on Azure. Authentication is provided by Azure B2C which allowed us to authenticate new users outside of the [Ekos Core](/projects/ekos-boost) platform.

Order Hub went from concept to first production release within 3 months of intense work. We wanted to get this product out for a specific conference which provided the best opportunity to show it off to all of our customers at once.
